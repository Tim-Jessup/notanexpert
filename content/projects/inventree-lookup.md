Chrome extension that finds part numbers in emails and looks them up in our company's InvenTree system. Built because I was tired of manually copying and searching part numbers all day.

## How it works

Scans emails for patterns that look like part numbers, adds little popup buttons next to them, clicking opens the part in InvenTree. Supports multiple lookup methods and keyboard shortcuts.

## Features

- Pattern recognition for various reference formats
- Context menu for selected text
- Keyboard shortcuts (Alt + I)
- Configurable patterns

## Lessons learned

Chrome omnibox, reassignable shortcuts, extension structure, How good are custom extensions??

## Could be better

- Could expand to other browsers
- Fallback search could go to an actual search page, but Inventree says no
- Need to check some errors

Works for what I need it for. Maybe it'll help someone else too.
