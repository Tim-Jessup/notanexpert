Chrome extension that makes it way easier to look up items in our company's InvenTree system. Built because I was tired of manually copying and searching part numbers all day.

## How it works

Adds a context menu option to search for selected text on InvenTree. Uses the API to direct the user straight to the right page. Supports multiple lookup methods and keyboard shortcuts.

## Features

- Pattern recognition for various reference formats
- Context menu for selected text
- Keyboard shortcuts (Alt + I or typing 'inv' in omnibox)
- Configurable patterns

## Lessons learned

Chrome omnibox, reassignable shortcuts, extension structure, How good are custom extensions??

## Could be better

- Could expand to other browsers
- Fallback search could go to an actual search page, but Inventree says no
- Need to check some errors

Works for what I need it for. I'll share it later on.
