A flashcard app for studying concepts that I've learned but want to lock in. Made because Ankidroid looks terrible and all of the other apps are pricey or rubbish.

## What it does

Allows the user to upload flashcard decks in CSV format. Does flashcard things. Looks good with smooth animations.

## Current status

- Basic functionality works
- Looks pretty good, with some minor issues
- Lots of features still to add

## What I learned

Vercel project hosting, teensy bit of react, vibecoding tbh

## Next steps

- Better style
- Add ability to have progressive decks
- Just try it out with some stuff that I want to learn
