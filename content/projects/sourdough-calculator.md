Simple calculator for scaling sourdough recipes. Made for myself but figured others might find it useful.

## Why this exists

Bread baking ratios are usually given in baker's percentages, but I think in grams. This converts between them and helps scale recipes up or down.

## What it calculates

- Total dough weight from hydration percentage
- Ingredient weights from ratios
- Scaled recipes based on desired loaf size
- Autolyse timing suggestions

## Status

Works well enough for my needs. Could use better mobile formatting. Math is straightforward but the UI could be cleaner.

## Try it

There's a working version on the Tools page. Source code is available if you want to modify it for your own use.
