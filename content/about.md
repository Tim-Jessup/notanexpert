## Not an expert, just curious

I build things to understand them. This site is where I share experiments, prototypes, and learning notes. It's mostly for me, but also for you if it's helpful.

### What I do

I work in electronics mostly, but I also bake and try to treat every attempt as an experiment. You don't fail experiments. You learn either way.

### Why this site exists

These projects and notes are rough drafts of my understanding and are likely to change. If something here helps you or sparks an idea, awesome. If you spot an error or have suggestions, please let me know so that I can learn from you.

### What you'll find

- **Projects**: Experimental builds, prototypes, and half-finished ideas
- **Tools**: Small calculators and utilities I built for myself
- **Notes**: Learning documentation, thinking out loud, rough explanations

Everything here is a work in progress, including this site itself.
