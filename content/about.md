## Not an expert, just curious

I'm Tim, and I build things to understand them. This site is where I share experiments, prototypes, and learning notes - nothing polished, nothing claiming authority.

### What I do

I work in electronics and embedded systems, specifically ESC design for UAVs. But my curiosity extends beyond work into bread baking, firmware development, power electronics, and whatever else catches my interest.

### Why this site exists

Learning is more fun when it's shared. These projects and notes are rough drafts of my understanding - sometimes wrong, always evolving. If something here helps you or sparks an idea, that's great. If you spot an error or have suggestions, even better.

### What you'll find

- **Projects**: Experimental builds, prototypes, and half-finished ideas
- **Tools**: Small calculators and utilities I built for myself
- **Notes**: Learning documentation, thinking out loud, rough explanations

Everything here is a work in progress, including this site itself.
